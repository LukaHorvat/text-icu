# Text-ICU: Comprehensive support for string manipulation

This package provides the Data.Text.ICU library, for performing
complex manipulation of Unicode text.  It provides features such as
the following:

* Unicode normalization

* Conversion to and from many common and obscure encodings


# Prerequisites

This library is implemented as bindings to the well-respected [ICU
library](http://www.icu-project.org/), which is not included.  The versions
of ICU currently supported are 4.0 and newer;
verified at least up to ICU version 55.
